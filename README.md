<h2>👋 Welcome to Warzone Spoofer</h2>
<p>Banned in Warzone? Don’t let it end your fight — we’ve got you covered.<br>
We’re a dedicated team crafting reliable tools to <strong>spoof your hardware ID (HWID)</strong> and bypass Activision bans with ease. Our tools are open-source, community-supported, and regularly updated to keep you undetected and back in the battle royale action of Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>

<h2>🔍 Understanding Warzone HWID Bans</h2>
<p>Activision, through its Ricochet Anti-Cheat system, uses hardware identification (HWID) bans to enforce fair play in Warzone. When banned, your computer’s hardware is flagged, preventing you from returning with a new account. A Warzone HWID Spoofer masks or alters your hardware’s unique identifiers, letting you bypass these restrictions seamlessly.</p>

<h2>💡 How Does a Warzone Spoofer Work?</h2> 
<p>A top-tier Warzone HWID spoofer modifies identifiers like serial numbers, MAC addresses, disk IDs, motherboard IDs, GPU serials, and other markers Ricochet uses to track bans. By spoofing these, your hardware appears as a fresh system to Warzone servers, letting you create a new account and drop in undetected.</p>

    <li>Follow our latest setup guides precisely.</li>
    <li>Keep your spoofer updated to match Ricochet’s latest anti-cheat patches.</li>
